# üëΩ `WinPostInstall.ps1` ‚Äì üõ∏ Alien-grade Post-Install Automation for Windows.

A highly modular, stealthy, and humorous PowerShell script designed to fully automate the post-installation process of Windows systems.  
Crafted for professionals, aliens, red teams, and paranoid sysadmins alike, it combines deep system hardening, bloatware purging, UI personalization, advanced Defender configuration, development and hacking toolchains, WSL/Exegol deployment, and much more.

This script ensures your machine is:
- Hardened against telemetry and common APT tradecraft
- Purged of bloatware, spyware, and retail-grade nonsense
- Preloaded with hundreds of curated tools (winget, store, direct EXEs)
- Beautified with dark themes and wallpapers
- Ready for offensive security, reverse engineering, development, and creativity

All that, with emojis, sarcasm, and APT-style stealth ‚ú®
